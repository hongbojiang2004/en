				<b>Title</b>: Towards Secured lSAC upon Commodity Wi-Fi<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>:
				
				With the widespread deployment of Wi-Fi and the development of Wi-Fi sensing technology, enabling commercial Wi-Fi devices to possess both sensing and communication capabilities, i.e., Wi-Fi integrated Sensing and Communication (lSAC), has become an urgent priority. However, the integration of sensing and communication based on commercial Wi-Fi faces two major challenges, distinct from the sensing-communication integration framework advocated in communication engineering. On the one hand, the inherent nature of Wi-Fi communication leads to a multi-static system deployment (i.e., separate 
				transmitters and receivers), which is incompatible with the monostatic deployment (i.e., co-located transmitters and receivers) commonly used in Rfsensing (radar), thereby introducing numerous error factors that affect sensing performance. On the other hand ISAC must adhere to commercial Wi-Fi standards to maintain good communication quality, which means it cannot use specifically designed (modulated) waveforms and must instead maximize sensing utility using existing Wi-Fi waveforms. In this report, we propose for the first time a revolutionary development path for fundamentally improving Wi-Fi hardware to achieve integrated sensing and communication, We will present the "two and a half steps" we have taken under this framework: 1) the hardware innovation of monostatic Wi-Fi sensing, 1.5) the evolutionary plan for commercial Wi-Fi multi-person sensing, and 2) the revolutionary solution for commercial Wi.Fi single-link multi-person sensing. <br>

				<b>Title</b>: Federated Continual Learning<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>:
				
				The goal of federated learning is to preserve data privacy when 
				training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, while continual 
				learning is to enable an AI system to acquire new skills without 
				forgetting old skills.&nbsp; To combine the capabilities of federated 
				learning and continual learning, federated continual learning (FCL) 
				arises.&nbsp; But before FCL can enjoy the benefits of both federated 
				learning and continual learning, FCL needs to be able to 
				effectively transfer knowledge across different clients and 
				across various tasks. Current FCL methods mainly focus on 
				avoiding interference between tasks, thereby overlooking the 
				potential of knowledge transfer across tasks learned by 
				different clients in separated time intervals. To address this 
				issue, in this talk, I will present a Prompt-based Knowledge 
				Transfer FCL algorithm, to effectively foster the transfer of 
				knowledge encapsulated in prompts between various sequentially 
				learned tasks and clients. <br>

				<b>Title</b>: Towards Edge-Native Foundation Models<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>: Foundation Models like GPT, LLaMA, and DALL-E 
				have been transformative in AI, demonstrating remarkable 
				versatility across tasks. Yet, the full potential of edge 
				computing—with its inherent benefits in cost, latency, and 
				privacy—remains untapped for deploying these models. In this 
				talk, we unveil the concept of Edge-native Foundation Models, an 
				innovative approach that harnesses the power of distributed, 
				diverse, and collaborative edge computing resources. We 
				introduce a user-friendly Edge FM-as-a-service system, allowing 
				seamless access to Foundation Model services without the burdens 
				of expensive deployment or intricate management. Furthermore, we 
				present a novel, environment-responsive adaptation strategy for 
				Edge-native FMs, enabling rapid tuning to meet the dynamic 
				demands of edge environments. Crucially, our methodology 
				emphasizes a commitment to ethical standards and regulatory 
				compliance for AI governance at the edge. We envisage a future 
				where Foundation Models are conceived, nurtured, and utilized 
				within the edge ecosystem. Our empirical findings suggest that 
				Edge-native Foundation Models could level the AI playing field, 
				disrupt the centralization of data processing, and offer a 
				viable, scalable architecture for AI's evolution. <br>

				<b>Title</b>: Is AI Good or Bad for Edge Sensing and Computing? 
				Advancements, Vulnerabilities, and Opportunities<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>: The pervasive usage of edge devices such as IoT 
				devices, smartphones, AR/VR headsets, delivery drones, and 
				autonomous vehicles, has experienced a notable upward trend. 
				This trend offers unprecedented opportunities for on-device 
				intelligence and a wide range of edge sensing and computing 
				applications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key 
				enabler enhancing the efficiency of these emerging applications, 
				including AR/VR applications, intelligent audio assistant 
				systems, and behavior-based user authentication. However, the 
				increasing reliance on AI also introduces inherent security 
				vulnerabilities, which pose significant threats when deploying 
				these applications in real-world environments. This talk aims to 
				discuss recent advancements in AI-enabled edge sensing and 
				computing achieved through hardware-software co-design and 
				on-device AI, highlighting their significant contributions to 
				achieving efficient inference. Additionally, it will delve into 
				the exploration of new attack surfaces, such as adversarial 
				attacks and backdoor attacks, that arise with the integration of 
				AI. Case studies of AR/VR applications and intelligent 
				edge-based audio systems will be presented to illustrate these 
				concepts. Furthermore, the talk will explore novel 
				opportunities, such as domain invariant modeling, which leverage 
				AI to enhance efficiency and bolster security defense in edge 
				devices, thereby advancing next-generation edge sensing and 
				computing capabilities. <br>

				<b>Title</b>: Intelligent Protocol Architecture for 6G<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>: The fusion of digital and real worlds in all dimensions will be the driving force for future 
				sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems. Ubiquitous in-time and on-time communication services between humans, 
				machines, robots, and their virtual counterparts are essential, and they expand from the ground to air, space, 
				underground, and deep sea. 6G systems are not only data pipelines but also large-scale distributed computing systems 
				with integrated sensing, processing, storage, communication and computing capabilities. It is challenging to build 
				ubiquitous and intelligent 6G systems, handling stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, providing a rich 
				set of communication modes, including unicast, multicast, broadcast, in-cast, and group-cast, and supporting 
				user-centric mobile applications. In this talk, we introduce a new protocol architecture that can provide a wide 
				range of control functions, and be intelligently configured for different types of 6G applications and networking 
				environments. Its design principles, self-evolving and transformative potentials, and open issues are discussed. 
				We also introduce two use cases applying the architecture to develop a delay-guaranteed routing protocol and a 
				mobility-aware multi-path QUIC protocol for seamless handover in satellite networks. <br>
