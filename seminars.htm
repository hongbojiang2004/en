				<b>Title</b>: How to reduce the reliance on data in deep 
				learning-based wireless research<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>: Deep learning has shown great promise in 
				solving many open challenges in wireless networking research and 
				applications and intelligence has been recognized as a defining 
				feature of the next generation wireless networks. However, deep 
				learning is data hungry, and one of the critical obstacles 
				towards fulfilling its promise is facilitating the acquisition 
				of sufficient amounts of data to train and validate deep 
				learning models. In this talk, we examine various approaches 
				that enable wireless researchers and practitioners to acquire 
				data more efficiently at reduced cost and to utilize existing 
				data more effectively. In particular, we will review several 
				effective approaches to reduce the reliance on data in deep 
				learning-based wireless research, such as data imputation and 
				augmentation methods with case studies. These approaches are 
				quite effective and general, and should be helpful to 
				researchers in this exciting field to tackle other data-drive 
				wireless problems. <br>
