				<b>Title</b>: Is AI Good or Bad for Edge Sensing and Computing? 
				Advancements, Vulnerabilities, and Opportunities<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>: The pervasive usage of edge devices such as IoT 
				devices, smartphones, AR/VR headsets, delivery drones, and 
				autonomous vehicles, has experienced a notable upward trend. 
				This trend offers unprecedented opportunities for on-device 
				intelligence and a wide range of edge sensing and computing 
				applications. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key 
				enabler enhancing the efficiency of these emerging applications, 
				including AR/VR applications, intelligent audio assistant 
				systems, and behavior-based user authentication. However, the 
				increasing reliance on AI also introduces inherent security 
				vulnerabilities, which pose significant threats when deploying 
				these applications in real-world environments. This talk aims to 
				discuss recent advancements in AI-enabled edge sensing and 
				computing achieved through hardware-software co-design and 
				on-device AI, highlighting their significant contributions to 
				achieving efficient inference. Additionally, it will delve into 
				the exploration of new attack surfaces, such as adversarial 
				attacks and backdoor attacks, that arise with the integration of 
				AI. Case studies of AR/VR applications and intelligent 
				edge-based audio systems will be presented to illustrate these 
				concepts. Furthermore, the talk will explore novel 
				opportunities, such as domain invariant modeling, which leverage 
				AI to enhance efficiency and bolster security defense in edge 
				devices, thereby advancing next-generation edge sensing and 
				computing capabilities.. <br>

				<b>Title</b>: Intelligent Protocol Architecture for 6G<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>: The fusion of digital and real worlds in all dimensions will be the driving force for future 
				sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems. Ubiquitous in-time and on-time communication services between humans, 
				machines, robots, and their virtual counterparts are essential, and they expand from the ground to air, space, 
				underground, and deep sea. 6G systems are not only data pipelines but also large-scale distributed computing systems 
				with integrated sensing, processing, storage, communication and computing capabilities. It is challenging to build 
				ubiquitous and intelligent 6G systems, handling stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, providing a rich 
				set of communication modes, including unicast, multicast, broadcast, in-cast, and group-cast, and supporting 
				user-centric mobile applications. In this talk, we introduce a new protocol architecture that can provide a wide 
				range of control functions, and be intelligently configured for different types of 6G applications and networking 
				environments. Its design principles, self-evolving and transformative potentials, and open issues are discussed. 
				We also introduce two use cases applying the architecture to develop a delay-guaranteed routing protocol and a 
				mobility-aware multi-path QUIC protocol for seamless handover in satellite networks. <br>

				<b>Title</b>: How to reduce the reliance on data in deep 
				learning-based wireless research<br>
				<b>Abstract</b>: Deep learning has shown great promise in 
				solving many open challenges in wireless networking research and 
				applications and intelligence has been recognized as a defining 
				feature of the next generation wireless networks. However, deep 
				learning is data hungry, and one of the critical obstacles 
				towards fulfilling its promise is facilitating the acquisition 
				of sufficient amounts of data to train and validate deep 
				learning models. In this talk, we examine various approaches 
				that enable wireless researchers and practitioners to acquire 
				data more efficiently at reduced cost and to utilize existing 
				data more effectively. In particular, we will review several 
				effective approaches to reduce the reliance on data in deep 
				learning-based wireless research, such as data imputation and 
				augmentation methods with case studies. These approaches are 
				quite effective and general, and should be helpful to 
				researchers in this exciting field to tackle other data-drive 
				wireless problems. <br>
